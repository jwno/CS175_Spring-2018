### Project Title: Hand Pose Estimation
### Project Number: Group 35

#### Project Description:
In this project, we used the YOLO, otherwise known as You Only Look Once, algorithm.  What this algorithm does is that it scans the entire image and detects different objects that are present within the image. We used this to our advantage to detect our hand in our picture.  Using the class dataset, we cropped the images to just the hands so that we could have YOLO detect hands in images. Using those images, the modified YOLO will intake the training and testing images, then correctly distinguish the hand pose for closed versus opened hand.
